# Prediction Using Decision Making Algorithm
## Overview
Welcome to the "Prediction Using Decision Making Algorithm" project! This repository contains Python code and Jupyter notebooks for implementing and evaluating a decision-making algorithm to make predictions on a given dataset. The decision-making algorithm, also known as a decision tree, is a popular supervised machine learning technique used for classification and regression tasks.

Decision Tree Algorithm
The decision tree algorithm is a predictive model that maps features (attributes) of input data to outcomes (labels). It works by recursively partitioning the data into subsets based on the values of different attributes. At each step, the algorithm selects the attribute that best separates the data into classes, leading to the formation of a tree-like structure. Once the decision tree is built, it can be used to predict the class label of new data points by following the decision paths based on the input features.

## Goals
The main objectives of this project are as follows:

Data Preprocessing: Perform data cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features to prepare the dataset for training.
Model Building: Implement the decision-making algorithm to create a decision tree for classification or regression tasks.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the decision tree model using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or mean squared error.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the decision tree by tuning hyperparameters to achieve better predictive performance.
Visualization: Visualize the decision tree to gain insights into the decision-making process and understand its structure.
#3 Dataset
The dataset used in this project could be any relevant dataset for classification or regression tasks. The dataset should contain features (independent variables) and their corresponding labels (dependent variable) for each data instance.

## Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset files (if not too large) or links to the dataset source.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation.
src/: Python scripts containing reusable functions for data processing and decision tree implementation.
results/: Saved model, performance metrics, and visualizations.
report/: A detailed report summarizing the decision-making algorithm's performance and insights.
Usage
To run the decision-making algorithm on a specific dataset, you will need Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using the requirements.txt file:

3# bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
After installing the required libraries, you can use the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to preprocess the data, build the decision tree model, and evaluate its performance.
